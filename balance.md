# balance

balance concerns:

1. combat
2. stealth
3. hacking
4. progression
    a. tools / equipment
    b. weapons
    c. player stats


for missions, having to search for objective location is great-
rewards being quiet, rewards being prepared, draws out mission length


## hacking

a number of slots in your cyberdeck for consumable software
limited slots: 3 or so
some software has multiple charges

### how software is acquired

the player crafts it according to ability on skill tree

## burglar tools

burglar tools are unlocked by beating special side missions that require and introduce the tool in question

specific equipment is rarely necessary to beat a mission
mostly, it helps by enhancing player ability to defeat common elements seen in most levels
    transformers
    lasers
    sensors
    cameras
    etc.
some tools are standard (lockpicks etc)
others enhance standard tools (faster picks, camera looper)
some provide new ability (cylinder pick)
in some cases, specialized equipment is necessary and provided (safe cracking tools)

## equipment

this is: thermal goggles, emp grenades, smoke bombs, etc.
not strictly required in any sense- more like weapons, subweapons;
their use is mostly self-explanatory

## knowing what to bring on mission

in theory, player can play mission and fail and retry

they might also play the game more than once, reducing surprise

so why not offer a built-in way to reduce guesswork? introduce: the spy network

this allows you to play the level in a special mode where you cannot beat objectives
but you can explore, record specific intel, map networks

if the spy is caught by a guard, they are ejected and player can try again or go forward with knoweldge gained.

afterwards, you can take the intel to the barkeep and he can point you to someone who knows how to defeat an rfid reader, e.g.

some intel is provided up front
some can be unlocked via tactic

intel is shown on mission tab screen

intel makes clear to player if they know an attack or not.

missions might proceed in general by first several attempts at mapping before putting together the real attempt.


## can you beat any mission with default loadout?

this is not strictly required of level design: see section "knowing what to bring on mission": recon & preparation can become important in later missions

but in general, it can be less about specific tools and attacks and more about *knowledge*, e.g. knowing where the target is
that is provided by tool use and recon.

even mapping e.g. the power network can tell you where to target to disable security systems.

technically you could work around it all, or bomb fuse boxes at random- but knowledgde enables you to be targeted.
