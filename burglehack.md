# hacking in burgle mode

how will hacking work?

## download

connect the hack tool, click download button, download timer appears on screen

an icon indicates there is data to be had

## hack

connect the hack tool, click the virus button, upload timer appears

an icon or text indicates what exploit an be leveraged?



how does hacking work on, e.g., the camera?
or the mainframe without a monitor?

connecting to an object should scramble the cyberdeck screen briefly,
then it configures to show possible actions.

it should also show actions that are currently not possible and why:
    need correct software
    need a better deck
    etc.

all datastores can display on a screen somewhere the icon that indicates there is data?
some consistent iconography on the object displays avaialable interactions.
    just like a lock or a doorknob indicates lockpicking, there needs to be a consistent indicator for data to steal
