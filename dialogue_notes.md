investigate dialogue
    the player is prompted
        the prompt should reflect the state of the level and any recent suspicion records.
            "why are you carrying a weapon? Identify yourself!"
            "are you authorized to be in this area?"
            "Red alert! Identify yourself or !"
    the player has multiple options to respond
        the outcome should depend on player skills
            charisma roll?
            etiquette?
            cyber?
        the outcome should depend on level sensitivity
        the outcome should depend on guard stats
        the outcome should depend on active suspicion records
            strikes against
    options to respond:
        LIE: plainly pit skill against interrogator
        BLUFF: relies on intel gathered in advanced or on-site
        ITEM: use an ID card, real or fake
        ESCAPE: distract the guard to run away
    outcome:
        success: player is cleared by NPC. guard will not bother them for the next 5 minutes, unless a new suspicion record is entered
        fail: player is identified as enemy, an aggressive suspicion record is added
        bonus: ?

factors in play:
    player skill
    level sensitivity
    guard stats
    active suspicion records
should be displayed visually, and consequences should be clear
what is the mechanic? a simple probability roll? that's kind of boring and invites avoidance?
    when a 32% roll fails, it feels like there was nothing i could do?
minigame: bad idea
better idea: being dealt a random assortment and picking what you think has the best chance of working
crazy: assessing the guard's gullibility, alertness, etc.

I like the idea of picking one option out of three, three times, to concoct a lie, and doing this strategically, and connecting it with the text generator
