# hacking 

* manual hacking conducted through burglar tool interface

i desire a more unified and fixed vision of cyber
    right now, hacking the camera is hacking the cyber node of the camera -> alarm node -> camera
    same with laser tripwire
    power source is not cyber connected - but should it be? sometimes? yes/no?
    manual hacking: randomized port? yes/no?
    manual hacking: related to network? yes/no?

## passwords
    passwords
 
## more data to steal
    some data is paydata
    some is useful for social engineering

## indicating type of node visually, so player knows ahead of time for their search
    hacking should indicate ahead of time the potential outcomes?
        hack camera to disable
        hack datastore to get data

## restricting visibility of network
    discoverable networks

## changing how compromise works
    today it 
    network hacking: limited range, hacking restricted by software

## compromise is dynamic
    maybe hacking only temporarily disables some components
        security camera is down / looped for x amount of time
        detected and fixed in realtime by ICE
    implanting a virus - self-replicating it spreads through the network



actions:
* download data
* break password
* compromise router
* compromise security camera

when a node is compromised:
    security device is disabled
    power is disabled
    datastore is unlocked

hacking a node can be done on network on manually

downloading data can only be done manually

scanner:
    maps network topology when spreadint autonomously
    locates different types of node
    locates different types of data
    identifies edges

virus:
    will make n total hops
    will do m simultaneous hops
    compromises nodes
    scans nodes?






# hack v2

hacking:
    network is discoverable
    nodes are discoverable:
        type:
            actuator
            datastore
                filename
                value
    nodes are locked / unlocked
        requires password breaking
    nodes are usable
        actuator: use object
        controller: disable object
        datastore: download data
ways to interact with nodes:
    discover node
    discover node type
    discover node connections
    discover filename
    activate actuator
    disable controller
    download file
    break password
what is the purpose of network then?
    there must be a way to attack a neighboring node from a given node
    maybe not unlimited movement as we have today- but one hop away
are attacks consumable?
pegged to specific cyber type?
how do attacks upgrade?
