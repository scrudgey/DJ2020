# hacking 

* manual hacking conducted through burglar tool interface

i desire a more unified and fixed vision of cyber
    right now, hacking the camera is hacking the cyber node of the camera -> alarm node -> camera
    same with laser tripwire
    power source is not cyber connected - but should it be? sometimes? yes/no?
    manual hacking: randomized port? yes/no?
    manual hacking: related to network? yes/no?

## passwords
    passwords
 
## more data to steal
    some data is paydata
    some is useful for social engineering

## indicating type of node visually, so player knows ahead of time for their search
    hacking should indicate ahead of time the potential outcomes?
        hack camera to disable
        hack datastore to get data

## restricting visibility of network
    discoverable networks

## changing how compromise works
    today it 
    network hacking: limited range, hacking restricted by software

## compromise is dynamic
    maybe hacking only temporarily disables some components
        security camera is down / looped for x amount of time
        detected and fixed in realtime by ICE
    implanting a virus - self-replicating it spreads through the network



actions:
* download data
* break password
* compromise router
* compromise security camera

when a node is compromised:
    security device is disabled
    power is disabled
    datastore is unlocked

hacking a node can be done on network on manually

downloading data can only be done manually

scanner:
    maps network topology when spreadint autonomously
    locates different types of node
    locates different types of data
    identifies edges

virus:
    will make n total hops
    will do m simultaneous hops
    compromises nodes
    scans nodes?
