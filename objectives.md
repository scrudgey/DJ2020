# objectives


a level template specifies multiple objectives.

objectives may be required for mission completion, or optional.

when all required objectives are complete, mission enters extraction mode.

objectives may have progress
    timer
    counter
    sub objectives? is there a reason to not just break these out like normal?
        kill person A
        kill person B


objectives may have order?
    1. breach the building
    2. locate the object
    3. steal the object
    4. extraction
when an objective is gated behind another objective, hide it? or grey it out?


objectives can fail?
    optional objectives: no problem.
    required objectives: no choice but to abort, extract, try again?

objectives should be communicated to player clearly


regarding sub objectives: lets not complicate things. no nesting. keep it flat and simple.
