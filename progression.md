# progression mechanics

the basic idea is that progression will be handled in the after-action report sequence.

after-action report will change from a static readout to more of a cutscene, with text overlaid.

## cutscene

the player character riding in a subway car, through a cityscape, over water, etc.

question: how to handle aspect ratio and all that?

answer: develop the custscene in 16:9 

1920x1080
960x540
480x270

## Report

fade ins can be preempted by player input.

fade in in order:

1. mission name
2. objectives:
    * objective A: COMPLETE
    * objective B: COMPLETE
    * optional objectives:
        * C : INCOMPLETE
        * D : COMPLETE

pause, wait for player to continue

3. reward:

    credits

    new balance

    optional objective rewards
        (favors, credits, anything else)

4. response text

    "good work, etc."

ease in all segments.
wait for player to click CONTINUE

## progression

1. progression should be controlled by a resource / token and can be done later so that if player
quits or crashes before progressing it is not lost.
basically, progression is assured once player completes mission.
this means there should be a way to trigger progression from inside apartment at least-
and progression interface should be modular.

2. there should be a way to see all possible future progress, like a tech tree or perk menu
this allows player to see possible future skills and plan / anticipate.
