# tools and equipment management

the basic problems:

1. if player uses plain credits to acquire equipment then they can get softlocked if they run out of money and don't have required equipment.
2. hard to know what equipment you need for a mission before you start it
3. if all equipment is available to purchase from one shop at the start, the player doesn't know which equipment to buy, which to bring, and what to use it on.
4. if the player has a stash of a lot of equipment, how do they know what to bring / what limits them from bringing everything?

## one solution

when the player encounters a new obstacle, they gain intel.
they can call someone and ask about this obstacle (how do i defeat a cylinder lock? how do i crack a safe? how do i get around the security door?)

the response they get can explain all the possible solutions
(disable the power, pick the lock, drill the lock, hit it with a crowbar, some cheap safes have a little latch you can spring with a shim)

for more complex stuff, or specialty equipment, they will point you to someone who knows- a new shop.

this shop has the equipment you need- a diamond tipped drill bit.
it also has a few other bits of equipment.

you can purchase it for a fixed price (100,000 credits) or a percentage cut of the mission you bring it on.
same with the other equipment.

## what it solves

0. player is never softlocked: only in debt
1. no tutorials: equipment and its usage is explained at the moment the player encounters the problem.
2. multiple solutions per obstacle
3. not all equipment is unlocked all at once: only a subset, most of which is relevant or interrelated.

## what it does not solve

problem 2
problem 4 (these are related)

if the player has to select equipment before the mission,
and they can't bring everything,
then they will encounter something during the mission that they are missing the tool for.

bringing equipment:
    you can bring more if you bring a backpack, duffel bag- makes you a little more suspicious (a neutral suspicion record)

## a possible bridge

there are burglar tools, and inventory items. 
burglar tools:
    acquired through non-monetary means
        the number of tools is limited and unlocking is perhaps arduous in some way but doesn't require money?
        at worst, a special mission that focuses on using the tool. 
    explained on-site via phone call:
        what the tool is used to attack
        how to use the tool to attack
        unlocks the tool, possibly
    you always bring every burglar tool

inventory equipment:
    purchased with money at a shop
    tools equiped during gameplay to make your life easier
    sub-weapons
    can apply backpack or duffel bag for larger equipment?

special purpose gear:
    diamond tipped drill bit
    nuclear material container
